"""
Courage's conversational memory (2026-09-26): short notes about the people he talks to, learned from conversation
and recalled by meaning in later ones. Everything stays local: the notes live in data/courage_memories.json on LXC 120,
the coordinator (:8001) decides what is worth keeping, the BGE embedder (:8003) finds what is relevant.

Write: after a conversational turn, a background call asks the coordinator for 0-2 lasting notes (most turns give
none). A note within DUPLICATE of an existing one only refreshes it.
Read: each turn, the user's message is compared with every note; up to RECALL_MAX notes scoring >= RECALL_MIN go into
the system prompt with the date they were learned. Calibrated on the live embedder 2026-09-26 (with BGE's query
prefix): relevant 0.40-0.65 with the right note always first; home commands and arithmetic 0.33-0.35.
John sees and deletes notes in Engine Console -> 🧠 MEMORIES (GET /api/courage/memories, POST .../forget).
