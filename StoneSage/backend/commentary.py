Commentary: when Computer speaks without being asked (Phase 3; John's rules, 2026-09-23: kitchen/living room plus
outdoor cams, at most ~6 a day, activity-based, one per episode, only when someone is home). No clock: 2026-09-27 John:
"There is no set day night sleep schedule ... It should be dynamic based on activity and the metrics reported", so the
old quiet hours (22:00-08:00) are gone; see Resting below.

Triggers (config.json commentary):
  arrival   a resident's HA person entity (Life360 / phone GPS) turns home after >= min_away_min away: the "just got
            home" flag. The welcome comes at whichever confirms it first (John, 2026-09-27: first sighting since):
            - a door (arrival.doors) used within ARRIVAL_WINDOW_S, either side: Life360 often reports home minutes
              after the front door has opened;
            - a camera sighting of that person by name since the GPS arrival (Frigate face, sentry, patrol);
            - any person on an arrival camera (arrival.cameras, Frigate) while no other resident is home, so it
              can only be them.
            No confirmation within ARRIVAL_WINDOW_S: no greeting (GPS noise, or they never came in).
            Residents arriving together share one greeting.
  cooking / cleaning   while a person has been around an activity camera (activity.cameras: Frigate camera -> room)
            for >= min_in_view_s (Frigate splits someone standing still into short events, median 16 s, so gaps up
            to PRESENCE_GAP_S count as still there), the vision model reads the frame every check_every_s, and must
            name the object that shows it (a pan, a cloth). Two such reads in a row start an episode (one misread
            never speaks); it ends after EPISODE_GAP_S without one.
            No reads while a remark could not be spoken anyway (resting, budget used, nobody home, Echo on DND):
            the GPU is not spent on it.
Resting (instead of a schedule): would the remark wake someone? Only the residents home who are NOT being addressed
count (an arriver or the cook is awake by definition). Each is
  awake    their phone is in use now or was within awake_min, or a camera saw them by name within awake_min
           or they got home (Life360) within awake_min, or their watch counted wear_steps_awake steps since its
           previous sync within wear_awake_min
  asleep   their phone's sleep confidence (Google's sleep API via the HA companion app) >= sleep_confidence, or their
           watch's body battery rose >= 2 % since its previous sync with no steps (Garmin only charges it at rest;
           Garmin Connect reports sleep itself only after waking, so this is the live sign)
  unknown  otherwise (Savannah has no phone or watch in HA yet: she is judged by the house)
Anyone asleep -> held. Anyone unknown -> held if the house showed no sign of life for idle_min before the event began:
no door, no person on a camera, no Echo voice command, no phone in use (the event's own signs don't count).
Gates, in order: enabled, a resident home, resting, the budget (daily_budget spoken in any 24 h, rolling, so no midnight
reset), the room's cooldown, the room Echo's Do Not Disturb switch. A held-back episode is used up (no remark later for the same one) and still traced.
A remark is one short tool-free coordinator call (persona + the facts + the last few remarks, so it does not repeat
itself). mode "speak" announces it on the room's Echo, "log" only records it (shadow mode); mode may also be a dict per
trigger ({"arrival": "speak", "cooking": "log"}) so a trigger can prove itself in the trace before it talks.
Every candidate is one trace record, kind "commentary": trigger, room, who, facts, outcome (spoken | logged | held |
failed), why it was held, the remark and timings.
